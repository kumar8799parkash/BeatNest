dotenv:

.env doesn’t have a “full form” like an acronym — it simply stands for “environment” file.
Purpose of .env:
    1. Hide secrets (DB passwords, API keys, JWT secrets).
    2. Easier config changes → e.g. different port for dev and production.
    3. Clean code → no more hardcoding like "mongodb://admin:1234@localhost:27017" directly in your files.


dotenv.config();                            // This line reads your .env file and adds the variables inside it to process.env
                                            // So after dotenv.config(), you can use process.env.MY_VARIABLE anywhere in your app.




MONGOOSE : 
    MongoDB itself is schema-less (you can insert anything into a collection).
    But in real-world apps, we usually want structure — for example, a User should always have name, email, and password.


BCRYPT:
    ⚙️ Features of bcrypt:
            One-way function → You cannot reverse bcrypt to get the original password.
            Salted → It automatically generates a random salt (extra random string) for each password to prevent rainbow table attacks.
            Adaptive cost factor → You can increase its computational cost (rounds) as hardware gets faster, making brute force attacks harder.

              const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10); // Hash password with 10 salted rounds
